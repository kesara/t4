      Computing Aware Traffic Steering using IP address anchoring
              draft-bernardos-cats-ip-address-anchoring-02

Abstract

   The IETF CATS WG addresses the problem of how the network
   infrastructure can steer traffic between clients of a service and
   sites offering the service, considering both network metrics (such as
   bandwidth and latency), and compute metrics (such as processing,
   storage capabilities, and capacity).

   This document defines new extensions for a terminal connected to a
   network infrastructure, to request a service with specific
   connectivity and computing requirements, so traffic is steered to an
   instance meeting both requirements.  Both CATS-aware and -unaware
   terminals are considered.  Exemplary signaling control messages and
   operation extending the well-known Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol are
   also defined.

1.  Introduction and Problem Statement

1.1.  Use case scenario

   Let's consider a possible use case scenario, just for the sake of
   illustrating the scenario.  A terminal is running an AR/VR/XR
   application (note that this is just an example, other services would
   also benefit from compute and connectivity traffic steering).  Part
   of this service is executed in the network infrastructure, posing
   some requirements on the connectivity (e.g., delay between the
   terminal and the node where the service is executed on the network
   infrastructure) and computing resources (e.g., capabilities to render
   the XR video within a certain latency budget).  Within the network
   domain where the terminal is connected to there are multiple sites
   capable of hosting the service, each with potentially different
   connectivity and computing characteristics.  Figure 1 shows an
   exemplary scenario.  Considering the connectivity and computing

   latencies (just as an example of metrics), the best service site is
   #n-1 in the example used in the Figure.

1.2.  Problem statement

   The main problem that this document tries to address is the
   following.  The network does not have mechanisms yet to enable
   service-specific connectivity and computing-aware traffic steering,
   which benefit from optimal service instance location selection and
   traffic steering.

   Based on the former, this document proposes solutions to enable the
   network to select the best site to instantiate a terminal service,
   taking into account service-specific requirements at both
   connectivity and computing levels.  In particular, this document
   addresses the following questions: (i) what information does the
   network need to be able to select the best location for a service to
   be instantiated?; and, (ii) how to steer traffic between the terminal
   and the selected service site, in a way that is transparent to the
   network forwarding infrastructure, and even to the terminal?

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms used in this document are defined by the IETF:

      ECR.  Egress CATS router.

      ICR.  Ingress CATS router.

3.  Enabling IP address service-specific anchoring for CATS

   We describe next an example of operation and signaling for the
   network to be able to select the best site to instantiate a service
   to be consumed by a terminal, so traffic can be steered
   simultaneously meeting connectivity and computing requirements.  A
   CATS agent is defined to run on both the ingress (the router to which
   the terminal is attached to) and egress (a router close to or at the
   site where the service instance is running) routers, and also at the
   sites capable of instantiating services.  Optionally, the CATS agent
   functionality can also run on the terminal to aid the network
   deciding or actively influence its site selection.  The CATS agent
   might have the following functionality:

   *  Instance selection engine: it deals with the procedures required
      to perform service and terminal specific instance selection.  For
      example, ICRs, ECRs and sites need this functionality so they can
      select the location of a given service instance.  Optionally, a
      terminal might also run this engine, to actively participate in
      the selection process.

   *  Traffic steering engine: it deals with the ICR and ECR selection
      and the associated traffic steering between them, in order to meet
      the connectivity and computing requirements of the service.  This
      functionality might be present at CATS agents running at ICRs and
      ECRs.

   In the following we describe an extended terminal service request
   procedure enabling the network infrastructure to select a service
   instance meeting the connectivity and computing requirements of the
   service, and the setup of the required traffic steering for the
   service traffic.  Extensions and new behavior are highlighted.  Note
   that variations are possible over this exemplary signaling diagram.

   A terminal wants to execute a service/app which is requires some
   functionality to be run on the network infrastructure (e.g., an
   AR/VR/XR service).  This service has specific requirements in terms
   of both connectivity and computing.  We refer to them as CATS
   requirements.

   1.  The terminal sends a Service request to the ICR, including a
       service ID and, optionally, if the terminal is CATS aware, a list
       of CATS requirements.  Note that this request might be addressed
       to an ICR or just intercepted by an ICR.  If present, the list of
       CATS requirements might include information such as (not limited
       to any particular combination of parameters):

       a.  Target bounded latency.

       b.  Target minimum bandwidth.

       c.  Target computing latency (type of operation, offered load).

       d.  Target required computing resources (e.g., hardware specific
           features).

       e.  Affinity constraints (e.g., "not to execute where function Y
           is already running").

       f.  Etc.

   There are two main options considered:

   2.  OPTION 1:

       a.  The ICR sends a query to all ECRs of the domain, or a subset
           selected based on the location of the ICR.  This query may
           include the following parameters:

           i.    Service ID: an identifier of the service requested by
                 the terminal.  This allows to check if the service can
                 be instantiated or it is already instantiated.

           ii.   Terminal ID: an identifier of the terminal requesting
                 the service.  This is useful for example for affinity
                 purposes.  It might not include information that can be
                 used to identify the user.

           iii.  ICR ID: identifier of the requesting ICR.

           iv.   CATS requirements: list of requirements, e.g.,
                 connectivity and computing requirements.

Internet-Draft          CATS IP address anchoring           January 2025


       b.  Each ECR, possibly after checking with the CATS agent of the
           site(s) it provides connectivity, responds, including the
           following information:

           i.    Service ID.

           ii.   Terminal ID.

           iii.  ECR ID: identifier of the ECR sending the response.

           iv.   CATS conditions: how the site meets each of the
                 requirements included in the request.

           v.    (Optional): URI to get to the service instance.

           A CATS agent at a site might be collocated with the ECR.
           Examples of a CATS agent at a site are network controllers or
           orchestrators at the site.  Note that the way a CATS agent at
           an ECR may interact with the CATS agent of the site is out of
           the scope of this document.  Examples include using
           monitoring and telemetry interfaces with an orchestrator
           managing the site.  Based on the received responses, the ICR
           selects an ECR. (step 4).

   3.  OPTION 2:

       a.  The ICR sends a query to a CATS controller in the domain,
           including the following parameters:

           i.    Service ID: an identifier of the service requested by
                 the terminal.  This allows to check if the service can
                 be instantiated or it is already instantiated.

           ii.   Terminal ID: an identifier of the terminal requesting
                 the service.  This is useful for example for affinity
                 purposes.  It might not include information that can be
                 used to identify the user.

           iii.  ICR ID: identifier of the requesting ICR.

           iv.   CATS requirements: list of requirements, e.g.,
                 connectivity and computing requirements.

       b.  The CATS controller, which has the overall view of all the

           following information:

           ii.   Terminal ID.

           iii.  CATS conditions: how the site meets each of the
                 requirements included in the request.

           iv.   Selected ECR: IP address of the selected ECR.

   4.  At this point, there is an ECR (and site) selected for use for
       the specific service requested by the terminal.

   5.  The ICR requests the proposed/selected ECR to establish a traffic
       steering session with it, sending a CATS request.  This request
       includes the same information that was included in the CATS query
       (to facilitate stateless operation of the ECRs while being
       queried).

   6.  The selected ECR, if it accepts the request, responds back with
       an acknowledgement, including the following information:

       *  Service ID.

       *  Terminal ID.

       *  ECR ID: identifier of the ECR sending the response.

       *  CATS conditions: how the site meets each of the requirements
          included in the request.

       *  IP prefix assigned for the terminal to use to reach the
          service instance.

       *  (Optional): URI to get to the service instance.

   7.  An IP tunnel is established between the ICR and the selected ECR.
       Forwarding is also setup so traffic going from/to the allocated
       IP prefix is sent through the tunnel at the ICR/ECR.

   8.  The ICR conveys the allocated IP prefix to the terminal.  This
       can be done using Router Advertisements, optionally enhanced with
       RFC 4191 [RFC4191] policies for the selected service.
       Alternatively, other options such as DHCP can be used to provide
       the prefix.

   9.  Traffic of the service for this terminal is steered using the IP
       tunnel.
