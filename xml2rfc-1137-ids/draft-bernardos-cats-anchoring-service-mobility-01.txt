   Service Mobility-Enabled Computing Aware Traffic Steering using IP
                           address anchoring
           draft-bernardos-cats-anchoring-service-mobility-01

Abstract

   The IETF CATS WG addresses the problem of how the network
   infrastructure can steer traffic between clients of a service and
   sites offering the service, considering both network metrics (such as
   bandwidth and latency), and compute metrics (such as processing,
   storage capabilities, and capacity).

   This document defines new extensions and procedures for a terminal
   connected to a network infrastructure, to benefit from transparent
   service migration adapting to specific connectivity and computing
   requirements, so traffic is always steered to an instance meeting
   both requirements.  Both CATS-aware and -unaware terminals are
   considered.  Exemplary signaling control messages and operation
   extending the well-known Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol are also defined.

1.  Introduction and Problem Statement

1.1.  Use case scenario

   Let's consider a possible use case scenario, just for the sake of
   illustrating the scenario.  A terminal is running an AR/VR/XR
   application (note that this is just an example, other services would
   also benefit from compute and connectivity traffic steering).  Part
   of this service is executed in the network infrastructure, posing
   some requirements on the connectivity (e.g., delay between the
   terminal and the node where the service is executed on the network
   infrastructure) and computing resources (e.g., capabilities to render
   the XR video within a certain latency budget).  Within the network
   domain where the terminal is connected to there are multiple sites
   capable of hosting the service, each with potentially different
   connectivity and computing characteristics.  Figure 1 shows an
   exemplary scenario.  Considering the connectivity and computing
   latencies (just as an example of metrics), the best service site is

1.2.  Problem statement

   The main problem that this document tries to address is the
   following.  Networking systems do not have mechanisms yet to service
   mobility mechanisms optimized for connectivity and computing-aware
   traffic steering, which consider both connectivity and computing
   status to dynamically select where a service runs for a given
   terminal.

   Based on the former, this document proposes solutions to enable the
   network to react and adapt to connectivity and computing conditions,
   triggering optimal service migration based on service-specific IP
   anchor mobility.  In particular, this document addresses the
   following questions: (i) what mechanisms does the network need to
   implement to facilitate the migration of a service so its
   requirements in terms of computing and networking are maintained?;
   and, (ii) how to steer traffic to a new service instance location
   after moving the service, in a transparent manner to the terminal, by
   using IP anchor mobility?

2.  Terminology

   The following terms used in this document are defined by the IETF:

      ECR.  Egress CATS router.

      ICR.  Ingress CATS router.

3.  Enabling service continuity with IP anchor mobility for CATS

   We describe next an example of operation and signaling for the
   network to perform service mobility.  Three different embodiments are
   described next, for variations (OPTIONS) of the procedures: terminal
   initiated, ECR-initiated and CATS-controller initiated.  In addition
   to the functionality defined in
   [I-D.bernardos-cats-ip-address-anchoring], this documents defines a
   new functionality:

   *  Service mobility: it deals with the procedures required to (i)
      detect or predict a change of the current conditions, jointly
      considering computing and networking, requiring of a service
      mobility operation; (ii) selecting the best target service
      instance location, and (iii) triggering the service mobility by
      orchestrating the service anchor mobility and requesting service
      migration to a new site.  For example, a terminal or ECR might use
      this functionality to perform active monitoring of a service with
      CATS agents running at the current ICR, ECR and or service site.
      It is also used to perform the actual service anchor mobility.

3.1.  OPTION A: terminal-initiated

   Next, we assume service mobility is triggered by a CATS-aware
   terminal.  By having a CATS agent running on the terminal, it can
   perform different monitoring actions to predict or detect the need to
   migrate a service from one site to another.  This CATS agent might,
   for example, interact with other CATS agents deployed on ICRs, ECRs
   and service sites.

   In the following we describe a service anchor mobility procedure for
   CATS, initiated by a CATS-aware terminal.  Following the terminal
   initiation, the network infrastructure is capable to select a target
   service instance meeting the connectivity and computing requirements
   of the service, with signaling procedures defined to perform a
   transparent anchor migration to a new site, facilitating the service
   migration in a transparent way for the terminal.  Extensions and new
   behavior are highlighted.  Note that variations are possible over
   this exemplary signaling diagram.

   Figure 2 shows the message sequence chart of the IP anchor mobility
   for CATS, initiated by a CATS-aware terminal (OPTION A), which is
   explained next:

   0.  A service/app has been already instantiated on a service site
       (for example, by using the mechanisms specified in
       [I-D.bernardos-cats-ip-address-anchoring]).  In this example, the
       site where the service/app consumed by the terminal is currently
       instantiated is site #n-1.  The terminal is connected to ICR #1



Bernardos & Mourad        Expires 12 July 2025                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   CATS Service mobility IP addr anchoring    January 2025


       and there is a service tunnel between ICR#1 and ECR#N-1.  This
       service/app requires some functionality to be run on the network
       infrastructure (e.g., an AR/VR/XR service).  This service has
       specific requirements in terms of both connectivity and computing
       (CATS requirements).

   1.  An internal or external trigger is generated regarding a change
       in the computing of networking conditions, making the current
       selected service site not feasible for the running service (i.e.,
       CATS requirements cannot be met).  In this OPTION A, the terminal
       is CATS-aware, and it the node that detects the change in the
       conditions (how this is made is outside the scope of this
       document, but possible mechanisms include: monitoring at service/
       app level, in-situ monitoring by the terminal, etc.) and sends a
       trigger to the ICR.

   2.  The ICR sends a query to all (but currently used) ECRs of the
       domain, or a subset selected based on the location of the ICR.
       This query may include the following parameters:

       i.    Service ID: an identifier of the service requested by the
             terminal.  This allows to check if the service can be
             instantiated or it is already instantiated.

       ii.   Terminal ID: an identifier of the terminal requesting the
             service.  This is useful for example for affinity purposes.
             It might not include information that can be used to
             identify the user.

       iii.  ICR ID: identifier of the requesting ICR.

       iv.   CATS requirements: list of requirements, e.g., connectivity
             and computing requirements.

   3.  Each ECR, possibly after checking with the CATS agent of the
       site(s) it provides connectivity, responds, including the
       following information:

       i.    The ICR sends a query to all ECRs of the domain, or a
             subset selected based on the location of the ICR.  This
             query may include the following parameters:

             i.    Service ID.

             ii.   Terminal ID.

             iii.  ECR ID: identifier of the ECR sending the response.

             iv.   CATS conditions: how the site meets each of the
                   requirements included in the request.

             v.    (Optional): URI to get to the service instance.

             A CATS agent at a site might be collocated with the ECR.
             Examples of a CATS agent at a site are network controllers
             or orchestrators at the site.  Note that the way a CATS
             agent at an ECR may interact with the CATS agent of the
             site is out of the scope of this document.  Examples
             include using monitoring and telemetry interfaces with an
             orchestrator managing the site.

       ii.   Based on the received responses, and considering both
             networking and computing metrics and policies, the ICR
             selects an ECR (#n).

       iii.  The ICR requests the proposed/selected ECR to establish a
             traffic steering session with it, sending a CATS request.
             This request includes the same information that was
             included in the CATS query (to facilitate stateless
             operation of the ECRs while being queried), plus the
             following additional parameters:

             *  ECR prefix: currently in use IP prefix IP to the
                terminal to reach the service instance.

             *  Lifetime: requested duration for the association between
                the ICR and the ECR.

       iv.   The selected ECR responds back with an acknowledgement,
             including the following information:

             i.    Service ID.

             ii.   Terminal ID.

             iii.  ECR ID: identifier of the ECR sending the response.

             iv.   CATS conditions: how the site meets each of the
                   requirements included in the request.

             v.    IP prefix assigned for the terminal to use to reach
                   the service instance.  It should match the one
                   included in the request.

             vi.   Lifetime: granted duration of the association between

       v.    An IP tunnel is established between the ICR and the new
             ECR.  Optionally (not shown in the figure), the ICR might
             send a CATS request with cero lifetime to the old ECR to
             remove the old tunnel.

       vi.   The previous message triggers the service migration (from
             site #n to site #n-1).  The specific mechanism is out of
             the scope of this document.  Note that some preparation/
             migration steps might be conducted in parallel (e.g., after
             messages #1 and #3) to accelerate the process, making this
             step just the final trigger for the service migration.  At
             site #n, the prefix used by the terminal for accessing the
             service is configured to be used by migrated instance.
             This might requires routing updates to be perfomed in the
             site, potentially controlled by a CATS agent running in the
             site.

       vii.  Traffic of the service for this terminal is steered using
             the IP tunnel.

3.2.  OPTION B: ECR-initiated

   TBD.

3.3.  OPTION C: CATS controller-initiated

   TBD.

4.  Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling extensions to enable service mobility
    with IP address service-specific anchoring for CATS

   The control plane extensions introduced in the previous section can
   be implemented over different protocols.  This section specifies
   extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6.  Only new options additional to what
   is defined in [I-D.bernardos-cats-ip-address-anchoring] are included.

4.1.  New ECR mobility option

   The new ECR option has the following format:
