 Simplified Local Internet Number Resource Management (SLURM) with RPKI
            Autonomous System Provider Authorizations (ASPA)
                 draft-spaghetti-sidrops-aspa-slurm-03

Abstract

   ISPs may want to establish a local view of exceptions to the Resource
   Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) data in the form of local filters or
   additional attestations.  This document defines an addendum to RFC
   8416 by specifying a format for local filters and local assertions
   for Autonomous System Provider Authorizations (ASPA) for use with the
   RPKI.

1.  Introduction

   ISPs may want to establish a local view of exceptions to the Resource
   Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) data in the form of local filters or
   additional attestations.  This document defines an addendum to RFC
   8416 by specifying a format for local filters and local assertions
   for Autonomous System Provider Authorizations (ASPA) for use with the
   RPKI.

   See [RFC8416] for an overview of the SLURM mechanism, specifically
   Section 3 and Section 4.

2.  SLURM v2 File Overview

   A SLURM file consists of a single JSON [RFC8259] object containing
   the following members:



Snijders & Cartwright-Cox Expires 12 July 2025                  [Page 2]

Internet-Draft             SLURM for RPKI ASPA              January 2025


   *  A "slurmVersion" member that MUST be set to 2, encoded as a number

   *  A "validationOutputFilters" member whose value is an object.  The
      object MUST contain exactly three members:

      -  A "prefixFilters" member, see Section 3.3.1 [RFC8416]

      -  A "bgpsecFilters" member, see section 3.3.2 [RFC8416]

      -  A "aspaFilters" member, see Section 3.1

   *  A "locallyAddedAssertions" member whose value is an object.  The
      object MUST contain exactly three members:

      -  A "prefixAssertions" member, see Section 3.4.1 [RFC8416]

      -  A "bgpsecAssertions" member, see Section 3.4.2 [RFC8416]

      -  A "aspaAssertions" member, see Section 3.2

   The following JSON structure with JSON members represents a SLURM
   file that has no filters or assertions:

   {
     "slurmVersion": 2,
     "validationOutputFilters": {
       "aspaFilters": [],
       "bgpsecFilters": [],
       "prefixFilters": []
     },
     "locallyAddedAssertions": {
       "aspaAssertions": [],
       "bgpsecAssertions": [],
       "prefixAssertions": []
     }
   }


3.  Validation Output Filters for ASPA

3.1.  Validated ASPA Filters

   The RP can configure zero or more Validated ASPA Filters ("ASPA
   Filters" for short).  Each ASPA Filter contains a single
   'customerAsid' and optionally a single 'comment'.

   *  The 'customerAsid' member has as value a number.

Internet-Draft             SLURM for RPKI ASPA              January 2025


   *  It is RECOMMENDED that an explanatory comment is included with
      each ASPA Filter so that it can be shown to users of the RP
      software.

   Any Validated ASPA Payload (VAP) [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile] that
   matches any configured ASPA Filter MUST be removed from the RP's
   output.

   A VAP is considered to match with an ASPA Filter if the following
   condition applies:

   1.  The VAP is considered to match if the VAP Customer ASID is equal
       to the ASPA Filter Customer ASID.

   The following example JSON structure represents a "aspaFilters"
   member with one object as described above:

"aspaFilter": [
  {
    "customerAsid": 64496,
    "comment": "Filter out ASPA Payloads which specify AS 64496 as the Customer ASID"
  }
]


3.2.  Locally Added ASPA Assertions

   Each RP is locally configured with a (possibly empty) array of ASPA
   Assertions.  Each ASPA Assertion MUST contain a 'customerAsid' member
   containing the Customer ASID and a 'providerSet' array of numbers,
   reflecting the set of Provider ASNs.  It is RECOMMENDED that an
   explanatory comment is also included so that it can be shown to users
   of the RP software.

   The above is expressed as a value of the "aspaAssertions" member, as
   an array of zero or more objects.  Each object MUST contain one each
   of all of the following members:

   *  An "customerAsid" member whose value is a number.

   *  A "providerSet" member whose value is an array of numbers.

   *  An optional "comment" member whose value is a string.

   The following example JSON structure represents a "aspaAssertions"
   member with one object as described above:

Internet-Draft             SLURM for RPKI ASPA              January 2025


  "aspaAssertions": [
    {
      "customerAsid": 64496,
      "providerSet": [64497, 64498],
      "comment": "Locally assert 64497 are 64498 are providers to 64496"
    }
  ]


   Note that an "aspaAssertions" member matches the syntax of the ASPA
   PDU described in Section 5.12 of [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis].  Relying
   Parties MUST add any "aspaAssertions" member thus found to the set of
   ASPA PDUs, excluding duplicates, when using version 2 of the RPKI-
   Router protocol [I-D.ietf-sidrops-8210bis].  An "aspaAssertions" does
   not act as an implicit filter.

4.  Example of a SLURM file with ASPA Filters and Assertions

    "prefixFilters": [

      {
        "asn": 64496,
        "comment": "All VRPs matching ASN"
      },
      {
        "prefix": "198.51.100.0/24",
        "asn": 64497,
        "comment": "All VRPs encompassed by prefix, matching ASN"
      }
    ],
    "bgpsecFilters": [
      {
        "asn": 64496,
        "comment": "All keys for ASN"
      },
      {

Appendix A.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE
             PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942.
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".
