                    Mobility Capability Negotiation
                          draft-yan-dmm-man-14

Abstract

   Mobile peers exchange signals with networks, for both wireline and
   wireless domains, to negotiate capabilities for mobile registration,
   connection management, session establishment, service provisioning,
   etc.  Generally, mobility capabilities include the supported and
   provisioned resources along with associated protocols for certain
   mobility management scenarios.  While devices in the mobile wireline
   (IP) domain would mostly focus on the IP-related negotiation, devices
   in the wireless domain, e.g., the 5G system (5GS), embrace both
   mobile IP-related resources as well as wireless-specific
   capabilities.  Regarding both the mobile-IP and wireless domains, we
   have generalized two protocol categories for mobility capability
   negotiation & management, i.e., the host-initiated category that
   involves the direct & active engagement of mobile end devices vs. the
   network-based category over which mobile endpoints play almost no
   role in the process.  The classification and then the application of
   the two categories help us analyze the mobility capability
   negotiation for both the mobile IPv6 and the 3GPP 5G system.  The
   comparison of the capability negotiation under both the Home-Routed
   (HR) and the Local BreakOut (LBO) roaming cases in 5GS further
   reflects the feasibility of the protocol dichotomy.

1.  Introduction

   Mobile communication is the use of various technological systems to
   communicate while two or more communicating peers do not stay always
   in the same fixed locations.  In order to pass on messages
   successfully, mobile peers have to go through a procedure that would
   be mostly comprised of registration, connection management and
   paging, session establishment and management, service provisioning,
   dialogue, etc.  This process would involve the signalling exchange
   and capability negotiation among mobile peers.

   Generally, mobility capabilities include the supported and
   provisioned resources along with the associated protocols for certain
   mobility management scenarios.  While the scenarios are applicable to
   both the wireline and wireless domains, there do exist discrepancies
   between them.  For devices in the wireline domain (i.e., mobile IP ),
   they would mostly focus on the negotiation of IP-related address
   allocation & provisioning, traffic switching and redirection, as well
   as resource optimization.  While for devices in the wireless domain,
   e.g., 5G system (5GS), apart from the previously-mentioned mobile IP-
   related capabilities, there are other wireless-specific settings to
   be negotiated, e.g., the radio, the MM (Mobile Management) core
   network (MM CN), and the SM (Session Management) core network (SM CN)
   capabilities [TS.23.501].

1.1.  Terminologies

   *  Home network in wireless: the home public land mobile network
      (H-PLMN) in which a mobile subscriberâ€™s profile is held.  Mobile
      subscribers roaming to other networks (or the so-named visited
      network) will receive subscription information from the home
      network.

   *  Visited network in wireless: the visited public land mobile
      network (V-PLMN) to which the mobile subscriber has roamed when
      leaving its home public land mobile network.

1.2.  Protocol Categories for Management and Negotiation

   There exist different mobility management protocols.  These protocols
   have been standardized for versatile mobile scenarios.  A mobile
   node, i.e., so-called User Entity or UE, has to adopt some
   protocol(s) to negotiate, for certain scenarios like in the roaming
   case, via the visited mobile (access) network, with its home network
   for pre-configured or dynamically-provisioned mobility capabilities.
   The successful negotiation would help achieve the requirments of
   service connectivity and communication performance, for potential
   cases like the IP-domain roaming as well as the UE handover and

   migration in wireless network.

   Regardless, for either the IP-mobility or the wireless like 5GS, both
   the IP-related resource allocation and provisioning, e.g., IP
   addresses, mobile-IP tunnels, IP prefixes in visited domains, etc.,
   and the wireless related capabilities like the radio, MM CN, and SM
   CN [TS.23.501], etc., depend on the selection and application of the
   mobility management protocols.  These protocols could be deployed in
   the fields of both the home and the visited networks, including both
   the (access) networks and the UE entities themselves.  However, the
   objectives of achieving this type of homogenous mobility and the
   ubiquitous connections might be impaired by the diversified
   capabilities and requirements of the networks and/or the host
   entities.  Accordingly, a scheme and a procedure shall be in place to
   support the negotiation and selection of the mobility management
   protocol which a mobile host, i.e., either IP or wireless one, could
   adopt to access the network.

   While the scheme aims to guarantee the optimal and the most suitable
   mobility management protocol will be selected, the procedure is for
   the effective application of the protocol.  Though the selection
   procedure and notification scheme might be implementation-dependent
   because the home & visited networks, and UE entities have certainly
   different capabilities and preferences (e.g., subject to the settings
   of the mobility pattern of a 5G host [TS.23.501]), there are two
   general aspects to be considered:

   *  What principles should be followed for the protocol negotiation
      and selection?

   *  What procedure should be adopted for the protocol negotiation and
      selection?

   In this draft, the descriptions so far lead to two different protocol
   categories for mobility management, i.e., the host-initiated and the
   network-based protocols.  They are defined as follows:

   *  Host-initiated protocols: defining the mobility management
      protocols that require the involvement of mobile end devices in
      order to accomplish the mobility management.

   *  Network-based protocols: indicating the mobility management
      protocols that require the non-involvement of mobile end devices
      in order to accomplish the mobility management.

Internet-Draft                     MCN                      January 2024


   In order to inherit the features of the corresponding mobility
   management protocols, the capability negotiation modes are also
   mapped into these two categories.  That is, the host-initiated
   protocol accommodates the host-initiated negotiation while the
   network-based protocol embraces the network-based negotiation.

   Obviously, the difference between the two categories lies on the role
   of mobile end devices in the mobility management process.  We will
   explain in the next two sections how this dichotomy would be applied
   to the negotiation in both the mobile IPv6 domain (i.e., wireline)
   and the 3GPP 5G system (i.e., wireless).

1.3.  General Procedure of Negotiation

   The protocol negotiation could be included in the MN_ATTACH Function
   [MN-AR.IF] and the implementation may be based on new or extended
   signalling messages (e.g., ICMPv6, Diameter, and RADIUS).  Besides
   these, other protocols could also be used in certain specified
   scenarios, such as for extended IEEE 802.21 primitives, UE providing
   the supported protocol list to Access and Mobility Management
   Function (AMF) in 5GS registration and/or update procedures, etc.  In
   summary, the general procedure for protocol negotiation and selection
   might be:

   (a)  Because networks bear generally higher trustworthiness than end
        devices, upon the initialization of mobile devices, the network-
        based protocol shall be used as the default mobility management
        protocol once the network supports it, depending on local policy
        configuration.

   (b)  If a mobile node or UE prefers the host-initiated protocol and
        the local policy also grants it, then the protocol negotiation
        will be conducted to switch from the network-based to the host-
        initiated protocol.

   (c)  After the initial attachment (or registration in 5GS term) of a
        host, a mobile profile could be generated in the UEâ€™s management
        repository, e.g., HSS for 4G and UDM for 5G, to store the
        selected protocol.

   (d)  If the UE migration or roaming happens, the network will check
        the currently-selected or the UE preferred protocol during the
        re-registration process.  The network also needs to notify the
        host if the selected protocol cannot be supported herein.

   Evidently, when a mobile host accesses the network, authentication
   shall be executed before any mobility management service would be
   honored.  In order to support the mobility management protocol

   selection, new data, e.g., authentication vector or AV for 4G/5G,
   would be recorded by the network after the successful authentication.
   The newly introduced information shows the selected mobility
   management protocol and shall be updated when the adopted protocol
   changes.

2.  Mobility capability negotiation in wireline domain: Mobile IPv6

   Based on the host-initiated and network-based categories, this
   section analyzes the mobility capability negotiation on the mobile
   IPv6 domain.

   Fundamentally, there are four types of mobile IPv6-based mobility
   management protocols:

   (a)  Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol: the mobility management scheme
        based on [RFC6275]

   (b)  MIPv6 suit protocols: Based on the MIPv6 protocol, there are
        multiple extension protocols that have been standardized.  These
        protocols can be classified into two types: protocols for
        function extension and protocols for performance enhancement.
        In the context of MIPv6 suit protocols, any location update will
        be initiated by a mobile host and a redirection tunnel is
        established between the UEâ€™s home network and the UE in the
        visited network.

        *  The protocols for function extension are proposed to support
           some specific scenarios or functions, such as the Dual-stack
           Mobile IPv6 (DSMIPv6) [RFC5555] for mobility of the dual-
           stack nodes, the Multiple Care-of-Address (MCoA) [RFC5648]
           for hosts with multiple access interfaces, as well as the
           Network Mobility (NEMO) [RFC3963] for mobility of sub-
           network.

        *  The protocol type for performance enhancement of mobility
           management, such as the Fast Mobile IPv6 (FMIP6) [RFC5568]
           for fast handover, the Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6)
           [RFC5380] for hierarchical mobility optimization.

   (c)  Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) protocol: the mobility management
        scheme based on [RFC5213].

   (d)  PMIPv6 suit protocols: in order to reduce the protocol cost and
        further enhance the handover performance, this suit of proxy-
        based mobility management protocols is proposed.  Based on
        PMIPv6, the suit is comprised of a series of standardized
        extensions, such as the Dual-stack Proxy Mobile IPv6 (DS-PMIPv6)



Yan, et al.               Expires 11 July 2024                  [Page 6]

        [RFC5844], and the Distributed Mobility Management Proxy Mobile
        IPv6 (DMM-PMIPv6) [RFC7333].  Different from the MIPv6 suit
        protocols, the location update of the PMIPv6 suit protocols is
        triggered by the network entity and the transport tunnel is
        established between the anchor point and the UEâ€™s current
        visited network entity.  The mobile host itself needs to do
        nothing about the signaling exchange during the mobility (or
        roaming).  Particularly, the mobility is transparent to the IP
        layer of the host.

   Based on definitions from the Section 1.2, the above four types can
   be bucketed into either host-initiated or network-based protocols:

   *  Host-initiated protocols: Including the MIPv6 and MIPv6 suit
      protocols, along with some other solutions, e.g., the Host
      Identity Protocol (HIP) [RFC7401] and the IKEv2 Mobility and
      Multihoming Protocol (MOBIKE) [RFC4555].

   *  Network-based protocols: Including the PMIPv6 and PMIPv6 suit
      protocols, along with some other solutions, e.g., the GPRS
      Tunneling Protocol (GTP) [TS.29274][TS.29281].

   Figure 1 illustrates the scopes of the above different categories as
   well as their belongings to either Host- or Network- types:

       +----------------+        +----------------+
       | Network-based  |        | Host-based     |
       |+--------------+|        |+--------------+|
       ||PMIPv6 suit   ||        ||MIPv6 suit    ||
       ||+------------+||        ||+------------+||
       |||PMIPv6      |||        |||MIPv6       |||
       ||+------------+||        ||+------------+||
       |+--------------+|        |+--------------+|
       +----------------+        +----------------+


                Figure 1: Scopes of different protocol types

   In reality, the host-initiated protocols and the network-based
   protocols can certainly co-exist in fields, which might lead to the
   configurations of multiple protocol daemons on the mattered network
   entities and mobile hosts.  This bodes well for the need of schemes
   to support the negotiation and selection of the suitable mobility
   management protocol when a mobile host registers with an access
   network initially or triggers the handover & roaming later
   [PaperCombiningMobilityStandards].

Internet-Draft                     MCN                      January 2024


   In the procedure described in the Section 1.3, the network-based
   protocol is listed as the default selection.  However, in the mobile
   IPv6 domain, we believe the protocols bearing function extensions
   shall be given higher priority than those targeting for the
   performance enhancement.

3.  Mobility capability negotiation in wireless domain: 5GS General

   As we have discussed in the Section 1.2, for 5G wireless devices,
   apart from the normal mobile IP-related capabilities like addressing,
   provisioning, traffic switching and redirection, there are other
   wireless-specific categories to be negotiated, e.g., the radio, the
   MM core network (MM CN), and the SM core network (SM CN) capabilities
   [TS.23.501].  Further, the Section 1.2 elucidates that the host-
   initiated protocol requires the involvement of mobile devices
   themselves, and the network-based one puts the negotiation burden on
   network entities.  While the mobile IP-domain has been conforming
   near perfectly to this dichotomy, the 5G wireless system oversees the
   seamless integration of both types of protocols upon the IP-related
   and the wireless-specific capabilities.  That is, the 5GS mobility
   capability negotiation is subject to the control and management of
   both types of protocols.  Here, it must be clarified that, different
   from the common recognition in the IP domain, the term 'network' in
   5GS indicates both the wireless access network (i.e., RAN) and the 5G
   core system.

3.1.  5GS Mobility Capability Negotiation: Wireless-specific

   According to 3GPP TS 23.501 [TS.23.501], the 5GS mobility
   capabilities are comprised of the UE radio, the UE 5GMM core network
   (5GMM CN), and the UE 5GSM core network (SM CN) capabilities.  The
   negotiation handling is between the mobile device (i.e., UE) and many
   5G network functions (NFs), e.g., AMF, SMF, UDM, etc., as shown in
   the Figure 2:

   TS 38.300 [TS.38.300] , which contains a great deal of information on
   the Radio Access Types or RATs that the UE supports, e.g. power
   class, frequency bands, etc.  During the negotiation phase, this
   radio information can be sent by a UE and the AMF shall store the
   capabilities to avoid unnecessary radio overhead.  The UE 5GMM CN
   Capability is related to 5G core network and defined in
   TS 24.501 [TS.24.501].  It contains mainly non-radio related UE
   capabilities, e.g. the network-slice information, the NAS security
   algorithms, etc., which are transferred only upon the AMF to AMF
   changes.  During the initial negotiation as well as the mobility
   update (i.e., regarding the registration procedure), the UE shall
   send its 5GMM CN capability information to the AMF and the AMF shall
   store it.  The UE 5GSM CN capability is related to 5G PDU session
   establishment and management, requiring the involvement from the
   critical function SMF.  It contains the supporting indications of
   reflective QoS, multi-home IPv6, ATSSS, etc.

   As it can be seen, the UE radio, the UE 5GMM CN and the 5GSM CN
   capability handlings involve both the UE itself and the 5G system.
   An UE initiates the process by providing its capabilities to the
   network (i.e., the 5GS) and the network (via 5G NFs) negotiates based
   on the system settings.  This wireless-specific negotiation procedure
   is clearly an integration of the host-initiated and the network-based
   modes.

3.2.  5GS IP-address Negotiation: Mobile Entities

   As one of the UE mobility capabilities, the 5G UE IP address
   management is very flexible [TS.23.501].  It includes the allocation,
   release and the renewal of the IP addresses.  Based on the DNN
   configuration, UE subscription data and/or 5GS operator policies,
   along with the PDU session type as selected by the 5G function SMF, a
   UE could be allocated either IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix or both IPv4
   and IPv6 prefix/addresses.  While the allocation mode as determined
   by the UE subscription data bears the static nature of host-
   initiated, the operator policies, DNN-configuration and the selected
   PDU session type bode well for the dynamic network-based negotiation.
   Here, we want to emphasize again that the network in 5GS indicates
   both the wireless access network (i.e., RAN) and the 5G core system.

   For the network-based dynamic mode, based on a UE indication, the UE
   IPv4 address (and the IPv6 prefix) along with their (IPv4 and IPv6)
   parameters could be negotiated via three different ways:

   (a)  To be allocated by the SMF (of a PDU session), e.g., retrieved
        from the address pool corresponding to the PSA UPF for the said
        PDU session;

   (b)  To be allocated via DHCPv4/DHCPv6 with the SMF itself being the
        DHCP server;

   (c)  To be allocated via DHCPv4/DHCPv6 with external DHCP servers.
        In this case, the SMF will serve as the DHCP relay agent toward
        the DHCP server located in an external network.

   For the static host-initiated mode, a static IPv4 address and/or an
   IPv6 prefix could be negotiated and allocated by 5GC based on a UE
   subscription record stored in the UDM/UDR, or based on the per-DNN
   per-S-NSSAI record of a UE stored in the DHCP/DN-AAA server that is
   located either in the 5G core network or in the external domain.

   Actually, both negotiation modes may co-exist in the 5GS.  For
   example, the UDM/UDR can have a UE subscription record to fulfill the
   host-initiated allocation, and simultaneously a SMF might provide the
   network-based IP address management via DHCP/DN-AAA servers.  So, we

   might ask which negotiation mode will prevail in an operator network.
   While the existence of multiple modes is not uncommon in field,
   unfortunately, there is no definite prioritization specified in 5G
   standards to address the potential confliction.  In practice, the
   final determination is based on the locally configured policies in
   operator networks.  Of course, the (core) network settings might be
   more authentic than an individual UE subscription record, but it
   never excludes from giving the preference to the UE.

4.  Mobility capability negotiation in wireless domain: 5GS-roaming

   The Section 3 describes the general 5GS mobility capability
   negotiation procedure when a UE is located in and registered with its
   home mobile network.  However, when a UE roams to another network, or
   the so-called visited network, the UE still needs to negotiate its
   mobility capabilities.  The 5GS has defined two roaming
   architectures, i.e., Home-routed (HR) vs. Local Break Out (LBO).

4.1.  Mobility Capability Negotiation in Home-Routed (HR) Roaming

   According to 5G TS 23.501, in Home-Routed (HR) roaming, when a UE
   resides in the visited network, the visiting network data traffic is
   routed to the destination data network (DN) via the subscriber home
   network.  While HR provides more control to the operators upon
   offering roaming services, policies and charging the subscribers,
   however, it adds extra layer of complexity and lag in the network
   because of the extra traffic redirection.  The following Figure 3
   shows the HR-based roaming architecture.

Figure 3: Mobility Capability Negotiation in Home-Routed (HR) Roaming

   The UE is in the visited network (left).  There exists an N9 GTP-
   tunnel between the V-UPF and the H-UPF for traffic redirection.

   In the HR-roaming mode, the UE IP address negotiation and allocation
   are similar to the general 5GS scenario as in the Section 3.2.  When
   a mobile subscriber roams to the visited network, there are also two
   address management modes, i.e., the host-initiated static mode vs.
   the network-based dynamic mode.

   *  Network-based mode: while the UE is in visited network (i.e., the
      VPLMN as shown in the figure), it has to, via the visited 5GC,
      connect back to its home 5GC for address and parameters
      negotiation.  When the CP connectivity is established toward the
      home network, the three different ways for address management as
      explained in the Section 3.2 can be applied.  Please note that the
      mentioned SMF, UPF, DHCP, etc. are network functions in the home
      (wireless) network, which can be marked as H-SMF, H-UPF, or H-DHCP
      mode.

Internet-Draft                     MCN                      January 2024


   *  Host-initiated mode: in this case, while an UE is in the visited
      network, the UE subscriber record must be retrieved from the UDM/
      UDR located in the home network (or so marked as H-UDM/H-UDR).

   Regardless of being host-initiated or network-based, the IP address
   negotiation and allocation are determined by the home-network side.
   A roamed UE has always to talk to its home network functions for
   mobility capability negotiation.  In the HR-roaming, the home UPF or
   H-UPF behaves like a Home Agent or HA in the mobile IP domain.  For
   example, as shown in the Figure 3, any data traffic destined to the
   UE must be transported from the home DN, going thru the H-UPF (N6),
   then tunneled to the visited UPF or V-UPF (N9), then thru the GTP-
   Tunnel (N3) to the visited (R)AN, and finally delivered to the UE
   (located in the visited network).

4.2.  Mobility Capability Negotiation in Local Break Out (LBO) Roaming

   Different from the HR-based roaming, in LBO roaming architecture, the
   data session of a roaming subscriber is anchored in the visited
   network, without the need of redirecting toward the subscriber home
   network.  The following Figure 4 shows the LBO-based roaming
   architecture.  It shows clearly the N9 GTP-tunnel in the HR-based
   roaming does not exist anymore.

     Figure 4: Mobility Capability Negotiation in Local Break Out
                            (LBO) Roaming

   Also, similar to the general 5GS scenario as in the Section 3.2, in
   LBO roaming, the UE IP address negotiation and allocation are
   dynamically managed by the SMF, UPF, and/or DHCP mode in the visited
   network (marked as V-SMF, V-UPF and V-DHCP).  This is different from
   the HR-roaming because the decision of HR-roaming belongs to the home
   network side.

   Another discrepancy of the LBO- from the HR- roaming is that the
   visited PCF or V-PCF cannot access a UE subscriber record information
   from the UE home network.  That is, there is no retrieval of the
   host-based IP address settings from the home UDM/UDR or H-UDM/H-UDR.
   This excludes fundamentally the host-initiated scheme for IP
   capability negotiation (from the home network), and only leaves the
   network-based scheme (as provided by the visited network) with the
   consideration of the rules generated by V-PCF based on locally-
   configured policies according to the roaming agreement between the
   visited and the home networks.

   In the LBO-roaming, there is no need for a roamed UE to talk to its
   home network functions for IP capability negotiation.  Thus, the
   visited UPF or V-UPF behaves like a Mobile Access Gateway or MAG in
   the mobile IP domain.  For example, as shown in the Figure 4, the
   data traffic destined to the (roamed) UE will only transport through
   the visited DN, going toward the V-UPF (N6), then tunneled thru the
   GTP (N3) to the visited (R)AN, and finally delivered to the UE
   (located in the visited network).  This shows clearly no involvement
   of the traffic redirection (via any HA or Home Agent) as in the HR-
   roaming case.

5.  Security Considerations

   Generally, this function will not incur additional security issues.

6.  IANA Considerations

   A new authentication option or other signaling message option may be
   used based on the specific implementation.
